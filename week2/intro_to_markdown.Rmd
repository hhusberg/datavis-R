This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

You can write text freely outside chunks (see *Help -> Markdown Quick Reference* for detailed guidance).  
Chunks are marked with `{r}` and contain code.  


# Header

## Sub-header

### Sub-sub-header

View document outline from top right corner of the editor.  

#### Executing chunks

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. You can execute one line by pressing *Ctrl+Enter*. Output is shown below the chunk.  

```{r}
5+5
```

```{r}
x <- 10
x
```

#### Adding a new chunk

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. You can give a name to the chunk.  

```{r chunk_name}

```

#### Viewing output as HTML file

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). The HTML file can be viewed in a browser.  

The preview shows you a HTML copy of the contents of the editor. 
**Difference between Markdown and Notebook: unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. When knitting, it is checked that everything you need to run the code successfully is included in the .Rmd file. **

#### Plots

Plots will also show below the chunk, instead of the side tab (you can change this in the settings, if you wish).  
```{r plot}

```


#### Adjusting output figure size
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
